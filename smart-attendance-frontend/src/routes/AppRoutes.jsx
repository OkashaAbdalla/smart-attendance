 * Application Routes Configuration
 * Purpose: Define all application routes with React Router
 * Structure:
 *   - Public routes (/, /login, /register)
 *   - Protected student routes (/student/*)
 *   - Protected lecturer routes (/lecturer/*)
 * Note: Route protection is frontend-only (backend validates on API calls)
